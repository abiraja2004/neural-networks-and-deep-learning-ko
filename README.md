Neural networks and Deep learning ko
====================================

This is a translation of [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by [Michael Nielsen](http://michaelnielsen.org/). I started this project to learn more about deep learning. Also I wanted to share good study material to Korean students who also have a same interest.
